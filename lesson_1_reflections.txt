1.	How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
ans: It clearly tells you what the difference between the two files is.
     It gives us the line where the files are different and what is different.
     It also gives the line number so it is easy to look up.

2.	What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
ans: Pros: You can only commit when you think you have made reasonable change.
           You need not commit when you realize that you have done a mistake
           You can add comments each time you commit.
     Cons: You might forget to commit.
     		You might commit unnecessarily.

3. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
ans:  Saving multiple files in one commit, lets us track the status of each file when the other file was changed.

4. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
ans: git log gives us all the history of modifications. git diff tells us the difference between each commit.

5. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
ans: You can revert your changes anytime you want. Explore significant changes at very low level without freaking out.

6. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Creating a project and using git to manage it.
